    <p>We do all this testing, resizing pages to make sure every width looks good. Are we trying too hard? What would happen if we styled everything as a percentage of display width? Then the user could resize all they wanted and the design wouldn't vary at all. It's a different way of thinking, but worth pursuing.</p>

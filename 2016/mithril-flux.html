/*
 * For web applications, Facebook recommends an architecture called
 * Flux, which makes it easy to answer the question, "How did my app
 * get into this state?"
 *
 * Action -> Dispatcher -> Store -> View
 *
 * A state change is represented by an Action, which you can think of
 * as an event, though it doesn't need to be implemented as any of
 * JavaScript's event objects.
 *
 * Within a Flux app, all Actions (and thus all state changes) go
 * through a single Dispatcher. Any code that needs to handle state
 * changes does so by registering a handler with the Dispatcher.
 *
 * A Store is any JavaScript object that keeps state for the app,
 * whether it's UI state or just data. An app can have just one store
 * (redux works this way), or you can split an app into multiple
 * stores for modularity. Modularity / loose coupling was the big
 * selling point for Flux I saw watching the video:
 * https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html
 *
 * A View translates app state from the Store(s) into HTML. For Flux
 * to be practical, the View has to know how to efficiently change the
 * DOM in response to state changes, using code that reads simply as
 * if you're only ever rendering once. React does this, but on mobile
 * phones the time needed to download 133KB of JavaScript, decompress
 * it and most importantly parse/compile it is considerable. I prefer
 * Mithril because it's about one tenth the size.
 *
 * Mithril components are similar to React components, but Mithril
 * components expect the view's primary communication with the rest of
 * the app to be through a controller, an object whose constructor is
 * part of the component. Flux expects a view's primary communication
 * with the rest of the app to be through a store.
 *
 * What we need is a project to fix the impedance mismatch between
 * Mithril's default architecture and Flux's default architecture. OK,
 * here goes:
 */

function FluxController(attributes) {
    // Let the store be the view's first parameter in place of controller.
    return attributes.store;
}

/*
 * OK, project finished. Now we can write Mithril components that look
 * like this Hello World example:
 */

var Hello = {
    controller: FluxController,

    view: function(store) {
        return <h1>Hello {store.who}!</h1>
    }
}
/*
 * If you're surprised to see HTML embedded in JavaScript, read
 * https://github.com/insin/msx
 *
 * As mentioned before, in Flux, all state change within the app
 * happens via Actions sent through a central Dispatcher. To minimize
 * the amount of code in a view, I find it convenient to hide
 * implementation details in the store.
 *
 * Here's a view that changes state. Imagine writing tests for this
 * view and you'll see why I prefer not to explicitly call the
 * Dispatcher with an Action here.
 */

var ChangeName = {
    controller: FluxController,

    view: function(store) {
        return <p>Your name: <input onchange={m.withAttr('value', store.setWho)} value={store.who} /></p>
    }
}

/*
 * However, when you look in Hello World's main store it's obvious
 * that the setWho method adheres to the Flux architecture. To make a
 * store easy to unit test I like to make it a constructor function
 * that takes a dispatcher argument.
 */

function MainStore(dispatcher) {
    /*
     * Side note: I like to use meaningful variables rather than _this
     * since the former is more readable as you go deeper into the
     * constructor.
     */
    var store = this;

    /*
     * Supposing a view did want to dispatch an event directly without
     * going through one of the store's methods, it would still want
     * to be sure to use the same dispatcher the store is using.
     */ 
    store.dispatcher = dispatcher;

    function handler(payload) {
        if (payload.type === 'who') {
            store.who = payload.who;
        }
    }
    
    store.dispatchToken = dispatcher.register(handler);

    store.setWho = function(who) {
        dispatcher.dispatch({type: 'who', who: who});
    }
    return this;
}

/*
 * Clearly there's a cost for adhering to Flux in that setWho() is
 * implemented as two functions instead of one, but what you get for
 * that cost is the ability to add new features to your app that
 * respond to this state change. These features can be very loosely
 * coupled to existing features. For example, we can add a counter of
 * how many names you've had without making any changes whatsoever to
 * preexisting code.
 */

function NameCountStore(dispatcher) {
    var store = this;
    store.count = 0;
    function handler(payload) {
        if (payload.type === 'who') {
            store.count++;
        }
    }
    store.dispatcher = dispatcher;
    store.dispatchToken = dispatcher.register(handler);
    return store;
}

var NameCount = {
    controller: FluxController,

    view: function(store) {
        return <p>Count of names you have had: {store.count}</p>;
    }
};

/*
 * Up to this point everything's been a reusable store or Mithril
 * component. Now it's time to tie it all together into an app. We
 * instantiate a single dispatcher and use tie it to our stores.
 */ 

var mainDispatcher = new Flux.Dispatcher();
var mainStore = new MainStore(mainDispatcher);
var nameCountStore = new NameCountStore(mainDispatcher);
mainStore.setWho('World');

/*
 * Now the main Mithril component connects individual components to
 * their stores. Look at JSX documentation to understand the
 * syntax. If you decide you don't like JSX/MSX don't worry, it's easy
 * not to use it. The Mithril documentation eschews it.
